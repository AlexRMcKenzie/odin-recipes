    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It doesn't get easier than this! Brown some meat, then toss in the rest of the ingredients and hit start! Feel
        free to adjust the heat level by adding more chipotle peppers and/or adobo sauce. The cocoa powder and cinnamon
        are ideas I got from my favorite chili seasoning available at a local spice shop - they really transform the
        dish! I like to top this with sour cream, green onion and shredded smoked cheddar. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>

        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant PotÂ®) and select Saute function. Heat olive oil
            over high heat and brown ground turkey until crumbly, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion and jalapeno and cook an
            additional 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, kidney beans, tomato sauce, chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, and
